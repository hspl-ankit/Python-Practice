'''Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read documents online or
find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in function.
Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
And add documents for your own function'''

# abs functioin Returns the absolute value of a number
x = -7.25
print(x)
x = abs(x)
print(f"absolute value of x is {x}")
print(__doc__)

# chr()	Returns a character from the specified Unicode code.
z = chr(97)
print(z)
